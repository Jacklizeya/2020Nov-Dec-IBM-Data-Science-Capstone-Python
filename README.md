# Capstone-Battle-of-Neighborhood
This project is aiming to find the best neighborhoods to set up a electrical vehicle charging station plus an amazon hub locker
Introduction: Business Problem
The world is shifting fast towards new direction. Renewable energy and electrical vehicle are taking momentum and becoming more popular. People’s working style and lifestyle are also changed a lot by COVID-19 and we rely more and more on the online shopping. Amazon is gaining more revenue and become an inseparable part of our community.

Calgary is the largest city in Canada’s prairie provinces and capital of Canada’s energy industry. There are 1.3 million people living in Calgary. It is a vibrant city with high percentage of young people and engineers. They are willing to adopt the new lifestyle and lead the energy transition of the world.

Opening an electrical vehicle charging station plus an Amazon hub locker as a combo will be a good business idea in Calgary. It will be an important part of our community, people can work on their Amazon package while waiting for the car to be charged. Investors who grab this opportunity will be the business leader in the community as there are not many electrical vehicle charging stations and Amazon hub locker in Calgary yet.

We will use data science approach to gather information about Calgary’s communities, current gas stations, electrical charging stations and Amazon hub lockers, then we will find the optimal locations to set up business for future success. Investors interested will be willing to invest on the future business based on our research.
